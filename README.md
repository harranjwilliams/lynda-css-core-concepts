# lynda-css-core-concepts
This repository is being used to study and practice CSS using the exercise files from lynda

The idea behind this repository is that when I'm working on different machines, I don't have to keep going to lynda.com to download the exercises or if there are projects that depend on the previous project's work I don't have to start from fresh (even though most of the times lynda will supply an up to date file(s) for the new lessons/chapters).
